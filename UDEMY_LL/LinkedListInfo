Linked List can be made using

1. Structures - C or C++

as well as

2. Classes - C++

By writing the following code:

    Node *P;            It can only store the Node memory address
    P = new Node;       It actually is a memory address P is like 0x6000013e0040 - new means it is created in Heap

In the 1st line are we first creating a pointer on the stack,
then the 2nd line assigning the address of the Node to pointer P (where Node is created on the Heap)?

All the pointers we create like first, p, q, temp, last, etc. are created in stack,
right? & from there then, points to specific nodes in heap as we want! - Exactly

Binary Search cannot be done on LinkedList
